# TechMine-PM
Remake of the good old "Mekanism" mod from MC: Java
Edition, but for PMMP
# Disclaimer
* This plugin will for sure not be the exact copy of 
the Java edition Mekanism mod, so please do not 
complain about missing features nor incorrect 
implementation of the existing features. The 
features provided are already extended to the limit 
of PMMP's capabilities. 

* I am not to be held responsible for any damage done
to your server by this plugin. There may be bugs/dupes
/performance issues as this plugin is planned to be 
in heavy development for a  verylong time
as of now. (If you do find a bug of some sort, which
does not relate to your server's performance, don't
hesitate to open an issue here)

* This plugin requires a server with good performance
(No estimate as of now) to run in a stable way.
# Current State
This plugin is in a big W.I.P as of now, and should
not be used at all. Does not function, and has a lot
of stuff that still has to be finished.

# API
Nothing in the API (Managers and such) is fully completed.
Don't depend on anything from the API as of now, as it
may get changes at any time until a stable release is 
reached.
